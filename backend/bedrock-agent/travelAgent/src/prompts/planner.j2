    "interests": <list from: "food", "photo", "culture", "hiking", "nightlife", "activity">,
    "difficulty_preference": <"easy" or "medium" or "hard" or "any", default "any">,
    "group_size": <number, default 1>,
    "special_requests": <string, anything else like "first time", "with kids", "rainy day">
}
